    "\n",
    "I encountered a few issues while implementing this assignment.  \n",
    "1. This was my first experience programming in Python, with the exception of modifying some Python 2 code for the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/).  That was trivial, as it was mostly moving paths, and adding parentheses to `print` statements.\n",
    "2. My brain had a hard time remembering which nomenclature was used for Lists and Dictionaries.  \n",
    "3. After being used to using a full-featured debugger, I was challenged by putting `print` statements throughout the code to try to figure out what was going on.  I ended up installing pyCharm, which helped immensely, once I figured out how to set it up for debugging.  Thankfully, I had used IntelliJ for CS455, so it wasn't too hard.\n",
    "4. When adding the examples using the 10x10 graph and using Tuples, I was unable to replicate the given results.  That took me back to the drawing board, and back into pyCharm.  I noticed there, that I was duplicating Tuples, putting `(0,0)` into the children multiple times.  This seemed to be because the successors function returned not only what I considered to be successors, but also the initial child.  Once I removed that, it seemed to work much better."
